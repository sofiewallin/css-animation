# Timeline of projects

A timeline of my school assignments and projects.

This repository and website is part of a school assignment where I'm learning Git and how to use GitHub. I decided to further my CSS-skills while at it, so I made an attempt at creating a CSS-only horizontal accordion.

## The assignment was to:

1. Create an account at github.
2. Create a new remote repository. Make it public.
3. Create a README.md file and describe the assignment with headings, lists etc. using markdown.
4. Create a simple website with optional content using HTML and CSS. Publish using GitHub Pages.
